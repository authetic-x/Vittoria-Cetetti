##  Standard

The Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. While there are many stories telling about its origin, the widely accepted one is to commemorate Qu Yuan, who lived in the Warring State Period. He conducted himself uprightly and brought peace and prosperity to Chu State so that he was much loved by the people. However, when a dishonest and jealous official framed Qu Yuan, he was disgraced and dismissed from office. Hearing that his country has been defeated by Qing State when he was in exile, he fell into despair and threw himself into the MiLuo River on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. It is said that the local people who heard the news raced out in their boats to retrieve his body and this evolved to be the origin of dragon boat races on the Dragon Boat Festival later. Afterwards, people dropped sticky rice into the river so that the fish and shrimps would eat them instead of Qu Yuan's body. This might serve as the source of zongzi.
